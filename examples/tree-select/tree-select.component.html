<!-- Basic
TreeSelect is used as a controlled component with ng-model directive along with an options collection. Internally Tree component is used so the options model is based on TreeNode API.
In single selection mode, value binding should be the key value of a node. -->
<p-treeselect class="md:w-80 w-full" containerStyleClass="w-full" [(ngModel)]="selectedNodes" [options]="nodes" placeholder="Select Item" />


<!-- Multiple
More than one node is selectable by setting selectionMode to multiple. By default in multiple selection mode, metaKey press (e.g. âŒ˜) is necessary to add to existing selections however this can be configured with disabling the metaKeySelection property. Note that in touch enabled devices, TreeSelect always ignores metaKey.
In multiple selection mode, value binding should be a key-value pair where key is the node key and value is a boolean to indicate selection. -->
<p-treeselect class="w-full md:w-80" containerStyleClass="w-full" [(ngModel)]="selectedNodes" [options]="nodes" [metaKeySelection]="false" selectionMode="multiple" placeholder="Select Item" />


<!-- Checkbox
Selection of multiple nodes via checkboxes is enabled by configuring selectionMode as checkbox. -->
<p-treeselect class="w-full md:w-80" containerStyleClass="w-full" [(ngModel)]="selectedNodes" [options]="nodes" display="chip" [metaKeySelection]="false" selectionMode="checkbox" placeholder="Select Item" />


<!-- Filter
Filtering is enabled by adding the filter property, by default label property of a node is used to compare against the value in the text field, in order to customize which field(s) should be used during search define filterBy property. In addition filterMode specifies the filtering strategy. In lenient mode when the query matches a node, children of the node are not searched further as all descendants of the node are included. On the other hand, in strict mode when the query matches a node, filtering continues on all descendants. -->
<p-treeselect class="md:w-80 w-full" [(ngModel)]="selectedNodes" [options]="nodes" placeholder="Select Item" [filter]="true" [filterInputAutoFocus]="true" />


<!-- Float Label
A floating label appears on top of the input field when focused. Visit FloatLabel documentation for more information -->
<p-floatlabel class="w-full md:w-80">
    <p-treeselect [(ngModel)]="value1" inputId="over_label" [options]="nodes" class="w-full" />
    <label for="over_label">Over Label</label>
</p-floatlabel>

<p-floatlabel class="w-full md:w-80" variant="in">
    <p-treeselect [(ngModel)]="value2" inputId="in_label" [options]="nodes" class="w-full" />
